# Odin - Etch-A-Sketch

## A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch

This project is a part of The Odin Project Foundations Course (JavaScript Basics) to practice all of the JavaScript knowledge I have acquired. This project shows how to do the following:
 
 * Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript
 * Implement flexbox to arrage the divs in a grid layout
 * Add a hover effect to change div colors as the mouse passes over them using JavaScript
 * Provide a button for users to input the number of squares per side for a new grid
 * Limit user input to a maximum of 100 squares to prevent performance issues
 * Ensure the new grid occupies the same total space as before
 * Modify square behaviour by randomizing RGB values
